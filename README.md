Here is a smart little software tool that could help you get values while solving some puzzle geocaches.

The addition of all and only the number digits present in the specified text is called a checksum . So, iconoclaste12345 will give 15.

The Digital Root is a mean of expressing a number as per the esoteric science of numerology. To evaluate this number, you just add all the digits between themselves until you get a one digit number.  So 15 will give 1 + 5 = 6 and 8134 will give 8 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 16 then  1+6 = 7. This specific field is for only the numbers present in the specified text.

For the two following fields, there is three evaluation methods:

A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26
A=26, B=25, ..., Z=1
Using the corresponding letter value on a telephone keypad
 

The Alpha Value field is the sum of converted alpha value of each and only the letters of the specified text. If the conversion table used is: A=1, B=2, ..., Z=26, so the text iconoclaste12345 will give 116. If A=26, result is 181 and finallly using the telephone conversion will give a value of 51

The Joint Digital root (or mix digital root) is the combined digital root of the alphabetical value of the specified text and the digital root of the digits present in the text. In the above example when using A=1, the alpha value of the word Iconoclaste is 116, so joining this number with the other digits present in the text will give the number 11612345 which result in a combined digital root value of 5. With the A=26 method, 18112345 equal 7 and with the telephone way, 5112345 = 3

The following field is an easy way to obtain the ASCII values of each characters entered.

Last field is simply the entered text reversed.
